# AlcoAware
AI system to determine whether to drink alcohol through user behavior analysis

## Abstract
In modern society, excessive drinking poses serious problems to traffic safety, personal health, and social well-being. To counter this problem, innovative solutions that can effectively detect alcohol consumption and mitigate negative effects are increasingly needed. In response, we propose the development of a mobile application that can evaluate an individual's drinking level using various sensor data and behavior patterns. We aim to accurately determine whether a user consumes alcohol by analyzing factors such as typing, device orientation, walking, location, time zone, age, and activity pattern. This proposal argues for the need for such programs by enhancing traffic safety, improving personal health, protecting youth, and supporting taxi drivers. By incorporating this technology into existing systems, we can proactively prevent accidents and promote responsible drinking habits.
